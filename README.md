# My Personal Website

This website is my first foray into web development.

Check it out at: [link here]!

## Coding :desktop_computer:

I used React to create this website. Animations were implemented using CSS, React
Reveal and Material UI. Before this project, I had little to no experience in web
development. Therefore, I had to learn as I go (my ratio of coding time to
Google time is therefore extremely skewed :dizzy_face:).

I also spent some time to make sure my website looks nice on both desktop displays
(even larger ones!) and mobile screens. You can see this in action by resizing your
browser window.

The initial version of the website was deployed through AWS S3.

## Future plans :telescope:

I intend to keep updating this personal website as I undertake new projects and reach
more milestones, so keep an eye out for that!

I also have a handful of technical and design improvements in mind:
1. A light-mode for the website that can be toggled by the viewer. Maybe plus some additional color palettes!
2. A hobbies / interests section.
3. More animations! For example, making the little mouse icon on the landing section 
bounce.
